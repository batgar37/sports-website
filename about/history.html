      <h1>History</h1>
      <h2>Where did i come from</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the rolling hills of
        France, there lived a young and ambitious student named Baptiste. He was
        a spirited and determined individual, known throughout his community for
        his passion for sports and his unyielding dedication to his studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptiste's love for sports was evident from a very young age. As a
        child, he would spend countless hours kicking a soccer ball around the
        local park or challenging his friends to impromptu races down the
        tree-lined streets. His parents, who had always encouraged his
        enthusiasm for physical activities, recognized his potential early on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, Baptiste's energy and enthusiasm for sports were matched
        only by his discipline and commitment to his academic pursuits. He
        excelled in his studies, earning top grades in school. His teachers
        often praised his strong work ethic and his ability to balance his
        schoolwork with his passion for sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he reached high school, Baptiste faced a turning point. He realized
        that he wanted to take his love for sports to the next level. He aspired
        to become not just a student but also an athlete. He began to train
        rigorously, focusing on a variety of sports like soccer, track and
        field, and even tennis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through hard work and dedication, Baptiste made a name for himself in
        local sports circles. He was an exceptional athlete, and his natural
        talent, combined with his unwavering determination, attracted the
        attention of coaches and scouts. Soon, he was competing in regional and
        national events, representing his town and school with pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptiste's journey wasn't without challenges. He faced setbacks,
        injuries, and moments of self-doubt. However, he used each obstacle as
        an opportunity to learn, grow, and become a better athlete and student.
        His perseverance and resilience were his greatest allies in the face of
        adversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Baptiste continued to excel in both sports and academics,
        universities took notice. His hard work paid off when he received
        athletic scholarships from several prestigious institutions. Baptiste
        faced a tough decision - choosing between pursuing his athletic dreams
        and his academic goals.
