      <h1>Yoga</h1>
      <p>
        Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in the Indian subcontinent,
        with a history that spans thousands of years. Its roots can be traced
        back to the Indus Valley Civilization, around 2700-1500 BCE. The word
        "yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit word "yuj," which means to unite or
        yoke, signifying the connection between mind, body, and spirit. The
        earliest mention of yoga can be found in the ancient Indian texts known
        as the Vedas. Over the centuries, various forms of yoga developed,
        including Hatha, Ashtanga, Vinyasa, and Bikram yoga, among others. Yoga
        became more structured and systematized with the codification of yoga
        sutras by the sage Patanjali around 200 CE. The practice of yoga
        includes physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama),
        meditation, and ethical principles. It was traditionally a spiritual and
        philosophical discipline, but it has evolved to encompass various
        physical, mental, and therapeutic aspects. Today, yoga is practiced
        worldwide, promoting physical well-being, mental clarity, and inner
        peace, while honoring its deep and diverse historical heritage.
