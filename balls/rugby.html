      <h1>Rugby</h1>
      <p>
        Rugby has a rich and storied history that can be traced back to the
        early 19th century in England. The sport is named after the Rugby School
        in Warwickshire, where, in 1823, a student named William Webb Ellis is
        said to have disregarded the rules of football (soccer) and picked up
        the ball, thus creating a new form of the game. This moment is often
        credited with the birth of rugby football. Over time, rugby underwent a
        process of codification, with the formation of standardized rules that
        distinguished it from soccer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rugby evolved into two main variants: rugby union and rugby league.
        Rugby union, characterized by its scrums, lineouts, and a greater number
        of players, gained popularity in the United Kingdom and other countries,
        leading to the formation of international teams and the Rugby World Cup
        in 1987. Rugby league, with its different set of rules and professional
        approach, also developed, primarily in Northern England and Australasia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both forms of rugby have grown in popularity and have their own world
        championships and passionate followings. The sport has expanded
        globally, with strongholds in countries like New Zealand, Australia,
        South Africa, and France. It is known for its physicality, teamwork, and
        camaraderie, making it a beloved sport with a rich tradition and a
        bright future.
