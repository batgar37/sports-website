      <h1>Soccer</h1>
      <p>
        Soccer, or football as it is known in most parts of the world, boasts a
        history that spans several centuries. The origins of the sport can be
        traced back to various ancient civilizations, but modern soccer as we
        know it today took shape in England during the 19th century. The
        Football Association (FA) was founded in 1863, and this marked a
        significant milestone in the standardization of the game's rules. The
        sport grew rapidly and, by the late 19th century, it had established a
        strong foothold across Europe and South America. The first international
        match between national teams was played in 1872, between England and
        Scotland. In 1904, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association
        (FIFA) was founded, serving as the global governing body for the sport.
        Soccer's popularity continued to expand, and it became a prominent
        fixture in the Olympics. The FIFA World Cup, which began in 1930, is now
        one of the most-watched sporting events in the world. Soccer has become
        a universal language, uniting people from different cultures and
        backgrounds in the shared passion for the beautiful game. It has evolved
        into a multi-billion-dollar industry, with countless professional
        leagues and millions of players and fans worldwide.
